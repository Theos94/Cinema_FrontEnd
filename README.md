Cinema_FrontEnd

Simple FrontEnd for my College project. It also comes with mock data and populates Local Storage with it on load, so a quick refresh
of a page might be required for it to load the data and for you to see it.

It doesnt use latest ES6+ JS features except let and const.

It is also not mobile first in design meaning its gonna look broken on mobile devices and smaller screens.

Some things will look good because of Grid and Flex but some like nav will be broken.
